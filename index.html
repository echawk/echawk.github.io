<p>My name is Ethan Hawk, and I&#8217;m a recent CS
graduate from Valparaiso University, and this
is my website. Here you&#8217;ll find write ups of
projects that I&#8217;ve worked on, an archive of
all of the writing that I did while working
for The Torch, the beginnings of a blog, among
other things.</p>
<p>Important note: any of the views&#47;opinions written here are strictly my own.</p>
