<h1 id="graduation-season-is-upon-us-heres-some-things-to-do-before-semesters-end">Graduation season is upon us: here’s some things to do before semester’s end</h1>
<p>It’s getting towards the end of the semester, and while everyone is rightfully excited for the summer and for the seniors to graduate, it’s important to remember to tie up any loose ends for this semester. So here’s a list of things you might want to remember to do.</p>
<ol>
<li>Thank your professors</li>
</ol>
<p>While some might recoil at the idea of thanking their general education professors, it&#8217;s important to remember that they were likely forced to teach that section just as you were forced to take that section. Even if it’s just a simple thanks for not giving you a lower grade on a paper because you incorrectly cited some random journal article from the library’s website in a format that you’ve never heard of before, reach out. For professors in your major, or who you’ve had many classes with, this invitation to give gratitude is even more important. These are the people who have most impacted your education at Valpo, so if you think it&#8217;s been worthwhile, maybe tell them thank you.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Finish your homework</li>
</ol>
<p>It’s definitely crunch time, and everyone is feeling it. While it&#8217;s often tempting to postpone and procrastinate your work until next week, it will catch up to you. Don’t spend the rest of the year worrying about whether or not you are going to have enough time to get all of your work done, just get it done. While this is usually easier said than done, if you get your work done now, the rest of the year can be spent relatively carefree (at least until finals).</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Enjoy campus</li>
</ol>
<p>With the weather finally starting to improve and stay consistently warm, make sure to enjoy the springtime views of campus. This is especially true for the Class of 2023, since for many this may be the last time for a while that they can wander the sidewalks and see the flowers in bloom. Granted, those photos are always posted to the university&#8217;s social media, there’s something different about seeing and experiencing all of it in person.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Reconnect with freshman friends</li>
</ol>
<p>This doesn’t mean you have to get all chummy with them, but catching up and seeing what people have been up to while you’ve been doing your own thing could be a good reminder of just how far you both have come. This especially applies if you are part of the current graduating class who had the year of Zoom-U.</p>
<p>Most importantly, just try to make the most of the time left. There really isn’t all that much left in the semester since classes end May 5. You’re only an undergraduate once.</p>
